Status : succeeded (as far as i know)

This was my attempted to make automatic Certbot renewal script of 1984.is FreeDNS .

But acme.sh officially support 1984.is FreeDNS : https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi#104-use-1984hosting-domain-api
and i found that after my script was finished .

**This Script doesn't work with TOTP enabled**

so, this script is a Certbot renewal script that's not maintained anymore, unless i returned to certbot .


certbot certonly --manual --manual-auth-hook before.sh --manual-cleanup-hook after.sh -d secure.example.com


Command Above should still working , i guess...
